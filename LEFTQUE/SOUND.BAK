/* Emits a 7-Hz tone for 10 seconds.

     True story: 7 Hz is the resonant
     frequency of a chicken's skull cavity.
     This was determined empirically in
     Australia, where a new factory
     generating 7-Hz tones was located too
     close to a chicken ranch: When the
     factory started up, all the chickens
     died.

     Your PC may not be able to emit a 7-Hz tone. */
